# Documentation

Written for someone who has never seen this repo before. Read them in order the
first time; after that use it as a reference.

The app's UI is German, the source comments are Arabic, and these docs are
English — that is a deliberate split (see [09-code-review.md](09-code-review.md),
"Three languages in one repo").
