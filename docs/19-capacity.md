# Capacity and the waiting list

Two numbers in the admin panel decide how many people the app lets in.
When either is reached, new users land on a waiting list and see their
place in the queue.

| Setting | What it caps |
|---|---|
| `Aktive Nutzer max.` | how many people hold a live subscription at once |
| `Neue pro Tag max.` | how many *new* people get in on a given day |

`0` means no limit. Both are enforced in `redeem_code()` — the one place a
subscription can be created — so there is no path around them.

**A waitlisted code is not spent.** Someone who arrives at a busy moment
keeps their code and redeems it when a place opens. Anything else would
punish a paying customer for the timing of their arrival.

## What each number actually costs

Everything below is on the free tiers. Ranked by which runs out first.

### 1. Writing correction — now free, with a daily ceiling

This used to be the expensive part: `claude-opus-5` at about **$0.09 per
correction**, or $1.80 per subscriber at a quota of 20. It now runs on
[Gemini's free tier](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits):
**1,500 requests a day, no card, no bill**.

So the money constraint is gone and a rate constraint replaces it. 1,500
corrections a day is far above anything this app will see at the user
counts below — but when it is hit, the student is told to try tomorrow and
their quota is not consumed.

The trade the owner accepted for that: Google's free tier may use the
submitted text to improve their models. See
[14-writing-correction.md](14-writing-correction.md).

### 2. Supabase egress — 5 GB/month, and audio will eat it

[Supabase Free](https://supabase.com/pricing) gives 500 MB database,
5 GB egress, 50,000 MAU, and pauses a project after 7 days of inactivity.

Today, without recordings, one exam sitting moves ~0.4 MB (≈30 KB of JSON
plus images). That is roughly **12,000 sittings a month** — not a
constraint.

**Once the Hörverstehen recordings exist, this becomes the binding limit.**
A full listening part is ~25 minutes of audio; at 64 kbps that is ~12 MB
per sitting, which is about **400 sittings a month** on the free plan.

Two ways out when that day comes, in order of preference:

1. **Serve the audio from Cloudflare R2**, which has no egress charge.
   Supabase Storage keeps the images; the mp3s move. This is the real fix.
2. Encode speech at 48 kbps mono and re-measure.

### 3. Cloudflare Workers — not a constraint

100,000 requests/day on the free plan, and the app is a cached PWA: a
returning student costs a handful of requests. At any user count that
Supabase can serve, this is nowhere near the limit. The
[paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/)
is $5/month if it ever matters.

### 4. Database size, MAU — not a constraint

Attempts and mistakes are small rows. 500 MB and 50,000 MAU are far away.

## Recommended starting point

**`Aktive Nutzer max. = 50`, `Neue pro Tag max. = 10`.**

Not because 50 is where anything breaks — it isn't, and now that correction
is free nothing on the stack costs money at all. Because:

- the waiting list is *visible* from day one, which is half the point of
  having one;
- the daily cap turns a sudden rush into a queue you can watch rather than
  a surprise;
- and it keeps you inside Gemini's 1,500/day while you learn what real
  usage looks like.

Raising a limit takes one field and a click. Explaining to paying customers
why the app got slow does not.

Raise it once you have a week of real numbers — the Übersicht page shows
active users, new today, and how many are waiting.

**Revisit before the recordings ship.** At that point either move audio to
R2 or drop the active cap to ~60, whichever comes first.
